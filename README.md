**QA Project**
**Project Planning**
For the planning of this project I used agile methodology and MoSCoW with my Trello board. The Trello board can be found at https://trello.com/b/JMNaG0Mb/crud-board

**Risk Assessment**
For this project I identified some risks that could have occured during the creation of the app. I created a Risk Assessment that I then went to and updated at the end of the project. The Risk Assessment has been uploaded and can be accessed through this Repository.
